# The-Hardcoded-Calculator
Why use operators like normal people do when you can hardcode everything.

## Why?
Why not.  

## Was all code under TestCalc.java handwritten?
Sadly, no.

I wrote a program that writes other programs such as TestCalc.java, and I called it writeCalc.java

## I've fallen into enough despair to have desires to use this tool.  How do I use it?

First, run writeCalc.java.  Currently, it writes a file around 1MB located in C:/temp.  If you mess with the variables a bit, you can change the file name, file extension, file path, and the estimated size of file.  Then try to run the new program you “created” and see what happens.  Or just leave it in your system for bragging rights.  “Look Ma, I got a 47 gigabyte java file”, speaking of that….

# Story Time
I wrote a 47 gigabyte java file once that took 3 hours for the program to write it.  Sadly, it couldn't run because java compilers just aren't designed for 47 gigabyte java files with 933,333,338 lines of code.  That was devastating; I fell into a hole and hit rock bottom.  But wait a second, I'm so far down I might as well go further.  Next step, write a java file hardcoding additional operations for every single integer in java (there are about 4,294,000,000 Integers in a 32-bit system).  According to my calculations, That’s around ∞ lines of code, or 800 exobytes.  That's 800,000,000 terabytes, or 800,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.  Yippie Yippie yay if I include other operators such as -,*, and / I can potentially create java files so big it’s going to make my hard drive explode.  But before that, I could start using doubles instead of ints.  Then I and after using every possible double, It will cause my harddrive to overheat slightly and cause another big bang and reset the entire universe.  Then, after the universe is reset, I could add exponents and logarithms and sines and cosines and tangents, oh and don’t forget the inverses and reciprocals of those.  After that, the harddrive will probably turn into antimatter or something, I don’t know, maybe Ctrl+Alt+delete all of time and space as we know it.  Whatever happens, it’s gonna be entertaining.
